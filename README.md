# fivem-redm-wrapper
FiveM to RedM natives wrapper.

The goal of this project is to create a complete and working wrapper to be able to import FiveM scripts and gamemodes to RedM without having to make any modifications. We aim to bring a perfect compatibility and translate all different sub-systems between the two games. For instance, adapting the FiveM clothes/components systems to RedM or even how notifications work as these were highly modified.
